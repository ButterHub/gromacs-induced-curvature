# gromacs-induced-curvature
Nanoparticle induced curvature simulation setup and analysis scripts.

Gromacs 4.6.5 was used for atomistic and coarse-grained simulations of Gold nanoparticle asymmetric insertion into a lipid bilayer, to induce curvature.

This project is in progress, but will finish around July 2018. Enjoy the following random images...
